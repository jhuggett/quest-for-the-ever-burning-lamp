# Quest for the Ever-Burning Lamp
> A Terminal Adventure Game

## Installation 
> Note: this game expect Truecolor to be available, see [here](https://github.com/termstandard/colors?tab=readme-ov-file#terminal-emulators) for a list of supported emulators. The game will look very odd without it.

Download the relevant zip (for you platform) from the [latest release](https://github.com/jhuggett/quest-for-the-ever-burning-lamp/releases).

Once downloaded, unzip the zip.

Review the `manual.txt`. Run the executable called `game` to play. Game related data is store in a local database that will be colocated with where the executable resides.

This game works on macOS. Windows doesn't seem to work.
